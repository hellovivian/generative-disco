Visuals are a core part of our experience of music. However, creating music visualization is a complex, time-consuming, and resource-intensive process. We introduce Generative Disco, a generative AI system that helps generate music visualizations with large language models and text-to-image models. Users select intervals of music to visualize and then parameterize that visualization by defining start and end prompts. These prompts are warped between and generated according to the beat of the music for audioreactive video. We introduce design patterns for improving generated videos: "transitions", which express shifts in color, time, subject, or style, and "holds", which encourage visual emphasis and consistency.

## System Design

Generative Disco's system design. Users begin by interacting with the waveform to create intervals within the music (#1). To find prompts that will define the start and end of intervals, users can brainstorm prompts using prompt suggestions from GPT-4 or videography domain knowledge (#4-6) and explore text-to-image generations (#7, #8). Results users like can be dragged and dropped into the start and end areas (#10,#11), after which an interval can be generated. Generated intervals populate in the tracks area (#15) and can be stitched into a video that renders in the Video Area (#9).

### Setup Option 1

Docker hub `docker pull hellovivian/art-ai:disco_local`


### Setup Option 2

*Requires a GPU with a decent amount of VRAM.

Install the package

```bash
pip install -U stable_diffusion_videos
conda env create -f disco_environment.yml
```

Authenticate with Hugging Face

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

```
conda activate video
python flask_app.py
```

## Repo Structure


The Stable Diffusion checkpoint used was V1-4. The web application was written in Python, Javascript, and Flask. Images were generated with 50 iterations on an NVIDIA V100. The music, assets (images), stylesheets, and Javascript are collected in the static folder. Logic and routing is controlled by `flask_app.py`


## Credits
The system was built on top of two open-source repositories: a) stable-diffusion-videos from Hugging Face, written by Nate Raw and b) wavesurfer.js. stable-diffusion-videos also builds on
[a script](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/00103b0037c5aaea32fe1da1af553355
) shared by [@karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy). The script was modified to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/nateraw/c989468b74c616ebbc6474aa8cdd9e53), which was then updated/modified to this repo.
